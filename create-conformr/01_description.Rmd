# Package setup

Every R package needs a DESCRIPTION file, so we start by specifying this information:

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9005",
    Title = "An opinionated toolkit for harmonising data",
    Description = "conformr provides tools and workflows for converting data between classification standards, 
    and correcting discrepancies in reported and calculated statistics.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "Cynthia",
      family = "Huang",
      email = "cynthia@gmail.com",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      ),
    `Config/testthat/edition` = 3
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "C. Huang")
```

Although it's not required, it can be nice to add some package-level documentation. This is what will show up when someone types `package?<your-package-name>` in the console.

```{package_doc}
#' Validated Data Harmonisation
#'
#' Provides an opinionated toolkit for harmonising data from related nomenclature or classifications into a single consistent validated dataset. Offers safe-guards against common but often subtle data loss or corruption mistakes.
#' 
#' @docType package
```

## Dependencies

```{r dependencies}
## imports
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
usethis::use_package("rlang")
usethis::use_package("cli")

## suggests

```

## Utilities

These functions are not exported.

```{r utils, send_to="R/utils.R"}
#' Defaults for NULL values
#'
`%||%` <- function(x, y) if (is.null(x)) y else x
```

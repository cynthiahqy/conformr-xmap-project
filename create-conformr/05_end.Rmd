# Conclusion {#conclude}

## Write internal data to package

```{r}
## defined in 02_basics.Rmd
usethis::use_data(equal_pm, internal = TRUE, overwrite = TRUE)
```


## Document the package

When you are done defining the package, it remains to convert the Roxygen to documentation.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
litr::document() # <-- use instead of devtools::document()
```

You can also add some extra things to your package here if you like, such as a README, some vignettes, a [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) site, etc.  See [here](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project/tree/main/examples/make-an-r-package-with-extras) for an example of how to do this with `litr`.

## Include pacakge README.md

```{r}
litr::add_readme(file.path("..", "source-files", "README.Rmd"))
```

# Creating `conformr` using Literate Programming via `litr`

To use the `conformr` package, go to the [`conformr` directory](conformr) for more details and installation instructions.

This repository contains the `litr` bookdown project used to write the `conformr` package. Rendering the `.Rmd` files inside `create-conformr/` generates all the R package files in `conformr/`. You can browse a rendered (though not necessarily up to date) version of the bookdown [here](https://conformr-project.netlify.app)


For more information about literate programming and using `litr` to write packages see the [`litr` project repo](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project) on GitHub, and the [pkgdown site for `litr`](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jacob-bien/litr/docs/index.html)

# Creating `conformr` and `xmap` using Literate Programming via `litr`

This repository contains the `litr` Rmd files used to write the `conformr` and `xmap` packages. Rendering the `.Rmd` files inside `create-conformr/` generates all the R package files in `conformr/`. You can browse a mostly up-to-date [rendered version of the bookdown](https://create-conformr.netlify.app). The `create-xmap.Rmd` and `xmap-source-files/` folder contain all the source files for the `xmap` package. The latest pkgdown site for `xmap` is [here](https://xmap-r-pkg.netlify.app).

For more information about literate programming and using `litr` to write packages see the [`litr` project repo](https://github.com/jacobbien/litr-project) on GitHub, and the [pkgdown site for `litr`](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jacob-bien/litr/docs/index.html)

xmap provides tools for creating, validating and modifying Nomenclature Crossmaps for use in Data Integration and Harmonisation workflows (i.e. in `{conformr}`).

## Creating an `xmap` object

If you already have a valid crossmap table, turn it into a `xmap` object by specifying the source (`from`) nodes, target (`to`) nodes, and weights (`weights`):

``` r
links |>
  as_xmap_df(from = ISIC2, to = ISIC3, weights = shares)
```

See `vignette("making-xmaps.Rmd")` for more details on validation conditions and creating custom weights.
